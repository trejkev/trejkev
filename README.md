Hi, I’m @trejkev

I’m interested in computer science, embedded systems, electronics, and robotics; currently learning SLAM algorithms through ROS. Constantly looking to collaborate on advanced computing, embedded systems, or anything else that could challenge an electrical engineer, you can reach me through trejkev@gmail.com
